# Community of Practice (CoP)

The Community of Practice (CoP) is the third phase in the Coaching process, typically led by the Head Teacher and supported by Lead Teachers.

This stage brings all teachers together to reflect on their experiences during the Coaching process, discussing both successes and challenges, and collaboratively developing strategies for improvement.

### Initiating a Community of Practice

To start a CoP session:

1. **Navigate to CoP Section**: From the home screen of the app, select the 'Community of Practice' option in the bottom tab bar.
