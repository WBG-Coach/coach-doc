# Community of Practice (CoP)

The CoP is the third step of Coach. It is conducted by the Head Teacher and can be supported by Lead Teachers.

At this stage, all teachers come together to reflect on the positive and negative points they had during the Coaching process and define strategies together to improve.

### Starting a Community of Practice
