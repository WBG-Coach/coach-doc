# Key Terminologies in Coaching

Understanding specific terms used in the coaching process can enhance clarity and effectiveness. Below are explanations of key terminologies:

## Class Observation

Class observation is the initial phase of the coaching process. It involves the coach scheduling and conducting a session to observe a teacher's class, assessing each teaching practice using the Coach's app. Post-observation, the coach and the teacher engage in a feedback session.

For more details, visit the [Class Observation page](class-observation/how-to-start).

## Coaching Session

A coaching session is the concluding phase of the coaching process, following a class observation. The coach identifies a teaching practice needing improvement and collaborates with the teacher to discuss necessary enhancements and action plans.

Learn more at the [Coaching Process page](coaching-process/how-to-start).

## Teacher Learning Circle

Teacher Learning Circles, facilitated by Head Teachers, are monthly collaborative learning sessions where teachers collectively focus on a specific teaching practice.

## Coach Profile

A coach profile includes personal details like name, birthdate, and identification numbers. It links all data collected by the coach at the school, including added teachers, class observations, and coaching sessions.

For more information, see the [Basic Usage page](basic-usage/creating-account).

## Teacher Profile

A teacher profile contains personal information of the teacher and links all data from class observations and coaching sessions. It also provides statistics based on this data.

For more on teacher profiles, visit the [Teacher section in the Basic Usage page](basic-usage/discovering-home) and [Teacher Data page](teachers-data/about-teachers-data).

## Incomplete Sessions

A session is deemed incomplete if a class observation is done without the follow-up coaching session. To complete it, the coach should schedule time with the teacher to conduct a coaching session and provide feedback on the observed class.

Further details can be found on the [Coaching Process page](coaching-process/how-to-start).

## Teaching Practices

Teaching Practices are key skills that a teacher needs to demonstrate proficiency in a subject. In the Coach's app, these are represented by question groups to be evaluated during Class Observation.

## Micro-Teaching Practices

Micro-Teaching Practices are more specific skills within a Teaching Practice. In the Coach's app, they are denoted by individual questions to be assessed during Class Observation and chosen during Coaching Sessions for targeted teacher improvement.
