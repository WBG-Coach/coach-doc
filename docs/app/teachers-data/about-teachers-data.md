# Teacher's data

As classroom observations and feedback are carried out in the application, the corresponding teacher's profile will accumulate data. Use this data to provide richer feedback and better guide teachers in their development.

The teacher profile presents two types of data: previous sessions and teacher statistics.

## Previous sessions

Once a teacher who already has other completed sessions has been selected, it is possible to view the class rating and feedback from old sessions, therefore, it is possible to see pictures uploaded and actions to improve submitted.

## Teacher statistics

After conducting the minimum number of 3 coaching sessions with a teacher, the statistics are unlocked.

With statistics you can visualize the historical evolution of the teacher for each Teaching Practice. This way, it is possible to check whether the teacher has improved or worsened in relation to previous sessions conducted.
