# Analyzing Teacher Data

As classroom observations and feedback sessions accumulate in the application, a comprehensive data profile is built for each teacher. This data is instrumental in providing insightful feedback and effectively guiding teachers in their professional development.

A teacher's profile in the app displays two main types of data: Previous Sessions and Teacher Statistics.

## Reviewing Previous Sessions

When selecting a teacher with prior completed sessions, you can access historical data. This includes class ratings, feedback from past sessions, uploaded pictures, and proposed improvement actions.

## Understanding Teacher Statistics

Teacher statistics become available after completing a **minimum of three coaching sessions** with a teacher. These statistics offer a historical view of the teacher's performance in each Teaching Practice. This feature allows you to track the teacher's progress over time, identifying areas of improvement or decline in comparison to previous sessions.
