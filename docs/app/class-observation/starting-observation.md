# Starting observation

On this screen, you will find detailed information about the professor, but the main focus of this topic is to make you aware of how to initiate a new class observation. Additionally, we aim to explain components to bring you closer to the application.

## New class observation

After you have a better understanding of the home screen on the previous page, as mentioned, if you click on a teacher, you will see their details and have the possibility to create a new class observation. All of this on a screen very similar to the one below:

In the center of the screen, you will find a blue button with the text "New class observation"; this button will take you through the flow to create a new class observation. After creating 3 class observations, you will notice that the "Teacher's stats" option becomes enabled.

## Edit teacher

If you click on **Edit Teacher**, you will see a form for editing the current teacher, with the same data you used to create it. Be careful when editing a teacher, as these data are shared across devices, so editing on a tablet means that in the next synchronization, other devices will also receive this update.

## List of sessions

On this screen, after creating the first **ClassObservation** for that teacher, you will see it in the list, containing some relevant information about this **ClassObservation**, such as:

- Creation date
- Average response in competencies
- Session name

If an exclamation mark icon is displayed on the right side, this session has not yet received feedback, which needs to be submitted.
