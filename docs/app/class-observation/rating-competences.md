# Rating competences

The principal aspect of the class observation is the rating process. On this screen, you can rate the class you are observing based on the Teaching Practices.

## How to rate

Click on a star to rate a Micro Teaching Practice.

The number of stars corresponds to the value of the rating. Therefore, the lower the number of stars, the lower the score. There are two types of ratings in the app: 3-star and 5-star.
For 3-star ratings:
- 1 star = Low rating
- 2 stars = Medium rating
- 3 stars = High rating

For 5-star ratings:
- 1 star = Needs work
- 2 stars = Keep working
- 3 stars = Almost there
- 4 stars or more = Doing great

# Finishing the class observation

Once the class observation is complete, there are 2 options to follow up: start a Coaching Session with the teacher or return to the home of the app.

## Start Coaching Session

If starting a Coaching Session was chosen, the feedback session will be started.

View more about in the Coaching Session topic.

## Return to the home

Returning to the home of the app will result in a Incomplete Session, which means an Observation Session was completed but the teacher still didn't receive a feedback about it.

Teachers with incomplete sessions will be displayed with an alert sign at the home of the app.
