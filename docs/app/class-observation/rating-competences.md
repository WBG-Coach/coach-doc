# Rating Competencies

A key element of class observation is the rating process. This section allows you to evaluate the class based on various Teaching Practices.

## How to Rate

To rate a Micro Teaching Practice, simply click on a star.

The number of stars selected reflects the rating level. Fewer stars indicate a lower score. There are two rating scales used in the app: 3-star and 5-star.

For 3-star ratings:
- 1 star = Low rating
- 2 stars = Medium rating
- 3 stars = High rating

For 5-star ratings:
- 1 star = Needs work
- 2 stars = Keep working
- 3 stars = Almost there
- 4 stars or more = Doing great

# Completing the Class Observation

Upon completing the class observation, two follow-up options are available: begin a Coaching Session with the teacher or return to the home screen of the app.

## Starting a Coaching Session

Choosing to start a Coaching Session will initiate the feedback process for the teacher.

More details on this can be found in the Coaching Session section.

## Returning to the Home Screen

Returning to the home screen without providing feedback will result in an Incomplete Session. This indicates that while an Observation Session has been conducted, feedback has yet to be given.

Teachers with incomplete sessions will be marked with an alert symbol on the home screen.
