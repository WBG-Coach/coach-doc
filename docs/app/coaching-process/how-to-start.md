# Initiating Coaching Sessions

Following the completion of a class observation, it's essential for the coach and the teacher to engage in a coaching session.

There are two scenarios for starting a Coaching Session: immediately after a class observation or by selecting a teacher with an incomplete session.

## After Completing a Class Observation

Once the class observation concludes, you have the option to either start a Coaching Session or return to the app's home screen.

:::caution Incomplete Session Alert
Opting to return to the home screen without initiating a Coaching Session results in an Incomplete Session. It's important to schedule a Coaching Session with the teacher at the earliest convenience.

## Managing Incomplete Sessions

Teachers with incomplete sessions are indicated by an alert sign on the home screen.

To provide feedback for teachers with incomplete sessions:

1. Select the teacher from the home screen to resume the session.
