# Starting Coaching sessions

Once the class observation is over, the coach and the teacher must conduct a coaching session.

There are two ways to start a Coaching Session: right after finishing a class observation or by selecting a teacher with a incomplete session.

## After a class observation

After the class observation is performed, you can choose between starting a Coaching Session or returning to the home of the app

Choosing return to the home of the app will result in a Incomplete Session.

## Incomplete session

Teachers with incomplete sessions will be displayed with an alert sign at the home of the app.

To perform a feedback for teachers with an incomplete session, select the teacher and resume the session.
