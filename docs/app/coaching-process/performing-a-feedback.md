# Conducting Feedback

During the Coaching Session, the coach is responsible for selecting a specific micro-teaching practice for the teacher to focus on and documenting the feedback.

## Choosing a Micro-Teaching Practice

The initial phase of the coaching session involves selecting a micro-teaching practice for improvement. Note that only **one** micro-teaching practice can be chosen per session.

:::tip Recommendation
It's advisable to choose a Teaching Practice that hasn't been previously focused on and has received a lower rating.

## Documenting the Feedback

The culmination of the coaching session is the recording of the discussion and agreed-upon actions for improvement with the teacher. Feedback can be entered either as a photo of handwritten notes or by typing directly into the text input field.
