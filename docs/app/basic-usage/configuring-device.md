# Registering a School

## Scanning the First QR Code

:::caution Important Reminder
During the process of adding a new school, ensure that your device does not disconnect or power off. It is recommended to have the battery charged above 30%.
:::

The initial step in adding a school to the application involves scanning its QR code. QR codes are generated by the platform administration and are typically provided as printed materials at the school. A sample QR code is shown below:

When you open the application for the first time, you'll find a button to scan a new QR code. Click this button, and you'll be prompted to grant camera access. Once permission is granted, your camera will activate.

Aim your camera at the school's QR code, fitting it within the on-screen square. The device will then display a loading screen and begin updating the application with the school's information.

## Adding Additional QR Codes

:::tip Quick Tip
This procedure is only applicable after creating an account in the application. If you haven't set up an account yet, please refer to the 'Creating an Account' section.

Once the first QR code is registered, you can add more schools to the same device. Remember, each QR code represents a different school. To register additional schools, simply scan their respective QR codes.

Follow these steps to add more schools:

1. On the app's home screen, select the "Switch Schools" option.
