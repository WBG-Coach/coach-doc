# Registering a school

## Reading the first Qr Code

:::caution Take care

During the process of adding a new school, your device must not disconnect or turn off. Ensure that the battery is above 30%.

:::

The first step to add a school to the application is to find its QRCODE. All QRCODEs are generated by the platform administration and are usually distributed. After finding a QRCODE, it should look like the example below:

When accessing the application for the first time, you will see the button to scan a new QR CODE. Upon viewing, you should click it, and a permission request for the device camera must be accepted. After accepting, your camera will be opened.

Once your camera is open, aim it at the school's QR CODE and fit it into the square marked on your tablet. Upon aiming, a loading screen will appear, and your device should start updating the application.

## Adding more than one QR Code

:::tip Tip

This process can only be carried out after the account is created in the application. If you do not have an account yet, please refer to the topic 'Creating an Account'.

:::

After registering the first QRCode, you still have the possibility to add any other schools you wish on the same device, remembering that each QRCODE represents a school. To register new schools, you need to scan other codes again and add them.

To do this, follow the steps below:

1. On the app's home screen, press the "Switch Schools" option.
