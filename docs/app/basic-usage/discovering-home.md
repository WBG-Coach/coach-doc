# Discovering the home page

The first page you will see is the home screen, where you'll find most of the shortcuts to access the app's functionalities. Due to this screen containing several shortcuts, we will discuss a bit about each component.

## Horizontal menu

In the first section of the home, where you see a horizontal menu, you'll find all the quick actions. These buttons quickly take you to specific screens within the application.

The quick actions include:

- **Start a new session:** Initiate a new Class Observation
- **Coach Script:** Documentation for coaches
- **Pending Sessions:** List of all teachers with a class observation but no feedback
- **Statistics:** Visualization of statistics for available teachers
- **Switch Schools:** Option to choose a new school
- **Switch Coach:** Option to choose a new coach account
- **SignOut:** Log out of the application

Over time, these functionalities may change, but the logic of this menu always leading quickly to a functionality will remain the same.

## Teachers

After the horizontal menu session, we have the complete list of teachers, with some key information about them, such as:

- Number of class observations
- Date of a class observation

Moreover, if you notice, there is a button on the top right that gives you the opportunity to create a new teacher if they do not exist yet. Feel free to click and navigate to the teacher creation screen. This screen will request some data about the teacher, and they will start appearing in this list.

If you click on one of these teachers, you will navigate to the detailed view about the teacher, and on this screen, you can create your Class Observation!

## Quick actions

Finally, the bottom part of the home screen offers the possibility to navigate to other app views that are more specific to your daily life, including:

- Teaching Learning Circles
- Pending Sessions
