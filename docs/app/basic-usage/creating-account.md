# Creating a account

After registering a new school, you will need to create an account or select your already created one if you have it. To do this, on the second screen, a list of application accounts is displayed. If yours is not present, you can click on "Create New Profile." When you click, some information will be requested, and it is extremely important that each of these questions be answered truthfully and accurately.

The screen where you will enter this information will be the same or extremely similar to the one below:

On this screen, we have optional and non-optional fields. Once you fill in all the required information, simply click on "Create Account." Congratulations! Now you have full access to the app.

The next topic refers to the screen you are currently viewing, the home screen. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to consult it.
