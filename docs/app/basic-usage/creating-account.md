# Creating an Account

Once a new school has been registered, you'll need to either create a Coach Profile or select an existing one if you already have it. Follow these steps to proceed:

1. **Selecting or Creating a Coach Profile**: 
   After choosing a school, a list of Coach Profiles will appear. If your profile isn't listed, select "Create New Profile".

   Clicking "Create New Profile" prompts you to enter various details. It's crucial that this information is provided accurately and truthfully.
   
   The screen for entering details will resemble the one below, with both optional and mandatory fields. After filling in all necessary information, click on "Create Account".
